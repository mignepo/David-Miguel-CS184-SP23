<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    For this project, we built the foundations for geometric modeling using Bezier curves and surfaces through de Casteljau altorithm. These structures formed the basis of our mesh of half edges, which we could manipulate through operations like flipping edges, splitting edges, and loop subdivision, in order to manipulate the geometries of the file. We also implemented Phong shading using area-weighted vertex normals in order to smooth the resulting geometries.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    The goal of de Casteljau’s algorithm is to create a smooth Bezier curve from a series of control points. It does this by finding points that lie along the lines connecting each of the original control points. How far the point is along the line is determined by the t parameter – for example, if t = 0.5, the point will lie at the midpoint between the control points. For n control points, once n-1 points are determined, new lines are created connecting these new points. This process is repeated until only one point is left, and that point lies on the bezier curve at t.
    We implemented this by implementing evaluateStep, which evaluates a single step of the algorithm. For each point parameter, we linearly interpolate between the current point and the next point with a factor of t to calculate a new point

</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    We can expand de Casteljau’s algorithm to render Bezier surfaces. To find a point parameterized by u,v on the Bezier surface, we first calculate the control points in the mesh for each row at parameter u. This will give us an array of Bezier Curves, each of which take up a column of control points, along a single dimension. At each row, we can evaluate each bezier curve for a given value, and construct a row of evaluated values  that we can use with 1D de Casteljau given parameter v on to find the point representation of our array.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first constructing a list of the vertices of each triangle by traversing with the half-edge class. With this list, we defined vector representations from the origin vertex to the other two vertices. Crossing these vectors, normalizing, and dividing by two yields the area of the triangle face. Similarly, crossing these vectors, and normalizing the cross-product gives us the normal vector to the triangle face. The area and normal vectors were calculated for all faces surrounding the vertex, and at the end we multiplied each normal by its associated area, and summed all the area-weighted normal vectors up. Normalizing this final result gives us the resulting area-weighted vertex normal for the specific vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented the edge flip operation by first saving all the pointers to the existing half edges, vertices, edges, and faces. Then we reassigned the next, twin, vertex, edge and face of each half edge such that the original middle edge now points to flipped vertices and all adjacent half edges are assigned accordingly. We added checks to never flip a boundary edge, and made sure to always use pointers not copies of mesh elements.

<p>
    Honestly we just had to double and triple check things over and over again. Sometimes our assignments were wrong.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>

  We implemented edge splitting in much the same way as we implemented edge flipping, except this time we created new elements – the additional midpoint vertex of the split edge, the three additional edges that result from the split, the 6 half edges associated with those three new edges, and the two new faces that come with the split. When reassigning values, we started with the original halfedges and referenced the newly created elements as needed. Reassigning the newly created halfedges was straightforward – we referenced a combination of new and old elements (some of the new halfedges, for example, pointed to the new midpoint vertex we created). Finally, we completed assignments for the remaining vertices, edges, and faces as necessary. To give it compatibility with loop subdivision, we had to make sure to set any newly created elements (new vertices, new edges that were not along the axis of the original edge, and new faces) to have their isNew property set to true. 

</p>
<p>
  We had to do some debugging, which was done by hand. Assignments had to be double, triple, and quadruple checked.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>

    We implemented loop subdivision through multiple stages. First, we iterated through all the original vertices and computed the updated positions for them. To do this, we iterated over each vertex's neighbor vertices to sum their positions and apply the formula: (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, where n is the degree of the vertex and u is the constant 3/16 if the vertex is degree 3 or 3/(8*degree) otherwise. Then we computed updated positions for new vertices that would be created by this upsample operation; to do this, we iterated over all edges and for each edge, calculated the position using a weighted average of 4 neighboring vertices illustrated by the formula 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D) where A and B are vertices along the split edge and D and C are the ends of their respective triangles. This position was stored in the edge for future reference.
</p>
<p>
  Next, we iterated through every edge and applied the splitEdge operation. splitEdge returns the vertex that was created as  result of the split, so we marked that vertex as a new vertex. We also took the position stored in the split edge and set that vertex's new position to that. Afterwards, we flipped new edges if they had one newly created vertex, and one old vertex. Finally, we iterated through all vertices one last time, and applied their new positions.
</p>
<p>
  Debugging this step was a pain, and we printed vertex positions and utilized the HalfedgeMesh check_for function to double check addresses and references to various halfedges and vertices. One bug that we realized was that we were working with a copy of the mesh, not the real mesh. This meant that we weren't adding vertices to the original structure, so fixing this allowed these vertices to show up.

</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After loop subdivision, meshes become smoother. Sharp corners and edges may be lost by subdivision.

<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/cubesub3.png" align="middle" width="50%">
</div>
<br>
 We can reduce this smoothing effect by presplitting edges that are surrounding the existing vertices. the more you pre-split the edges, the more resilient the vertex will be to losing its original shape. This is shown below, where we presplit a cube and then show it subdivided afterwards:

  <img src="images/cubepreserve.png" align="middle" width="50%">
</div>
<br>

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    By splitting every cross edge on each face of the cube such that every face now has two diagonal edges going across it, we ensure that the upsample will preserve the symmetry of the cube. This makes sense because upsampling will create multiples of each triangle, so if the initial mesh is not symmetric in its triangles, then this asymmetry will persist on subsequent upsamples.
